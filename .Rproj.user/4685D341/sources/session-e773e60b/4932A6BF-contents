```{r setup, include=FALSE}

## Learning to references figures

```{r}
x = seq(1:100)
y = rnorm(100)
dat = data.frame(x, y)
ggplot(dat, aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_line() + labs(caption = "This is random noice")
```
The noicy data is meaningless most of the time as there is too much variation (see Figure \@ref(fig:ggplot)

## Learning to reference tables

```{r}
install.packages("dslabs")
library(dslabs)
data("dat")

table_data <- head(dat, 5)
knitr::kable(table_data, 
             caption = "Random values generated from a normal distribution",
             digits = 2)
```
This data table (Table \@ref(tab:table_data) includes a sample of the data set that has been used to create the Figure \@ref(fig:ggplot).
